== External Dependencies ==

It is worth noting that this plugin uses an external script to load the NFT embed capability. This script will not collect any data nor does it require any need to connect to any third party to enable the script itself. This is the script offered by Opensea and hosted via the [unpkg.com CDN](https://unpkg.com/embeddable-nfts/).
